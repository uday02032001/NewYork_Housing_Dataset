# NewYork_Housing_Dataset

This project analyzes the New York house dataset to help users find their perfect home. I started by cleaning the data to ensure accuracy and consistency, and added several new columns to enable deeper analysis of the listings. Using pivot tables, I explored key metrics like price, square footage, and home features across different localities and home types.

To make the insights accessible, I built an interactive dashboard with charts and slicers. You can easily filter and explore the data based on your preferences-such as price range, location, or number of bedrooms-to discover the best house options for your needs. The dashboard provides a user-friendly way to compare listings, visualize trends, and make informed decisions.
